# Combined_Stochastic_Model1

Code complimenting the project and paper "Combined Stochastic Model for the Evaluation of Cancer Progression and Patient Trajectories".

The src folder contains all the code used for model building, optimization and visualization of the results.\
The data folder contains the datasets simulated and used for the experiments described in the notebooks.\
The output folder contains all the results, e.g. from the parameter optimization using the likelihood functions.

The code that aat the status of the paper is available on zenodo.\
Due to the large size result files from MCMC sampling are only available on zenodo or request to the author.
